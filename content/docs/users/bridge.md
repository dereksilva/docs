Reef Bridge is allowing for the unification of the $REEF ecosystem on Reef Chain, making it possible for people holding $REEF on Ethereum and BNB Chain to Reef Chain and take advantage of the growing Reef ecosystem.

To use Reef Bridge, you will need the following:

- An Ethereum or BNB Chain wallet
- $REEF on Ethereum or BNB Chain
- A Reef wallet with [Reef EVM address bound](https://blog.reef.io/claim-evm-address)
- At least 1000 $REEF in your Reef wallet

## Bridge Instructions

From there, visit [http://reefbridge.app](https://reefbridge.app), then:

- Connect your Ethereum or BNB Chain Wallet; Zerion, MetaMask, WalletConnect and Coinbase Wallet are all supported
- Connect your Reef wallet, **or** paste your Reef EVM address (0x format) and select 'Confirm'
- Enter the amount of $REEF tokens you want to bridge
- Select 'Transfer to Reef'
- You will approve two transactions: one to allow the bridge to handle your $REEF tokens, and the second to initiate the bridge

After confirming both transactions, the $REEF tokens on Reef Chain will be deposited to your wallet!

Here is a video demo of the bridge in action:
