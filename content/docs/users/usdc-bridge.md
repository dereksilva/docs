Reef USDC Bridge allows users to bridge, or migrate, wrapped USDC to and from any blockchains supported by VIA Lab's ProtoUSD protocol. Bringing wrapped USDC to Reef Chain makes it possible to enable decentralized finance platforms like lending/borrowing, perpetual trading, prediction markets, and more.

To bridge USDC to Reef Chain, you will need the following:

- A wallet for the source chain
- A Reef wallet with [an EVM address bound](https://blog.reef.io/claim-evm-address)
- At least 1000 $REEF in your Reef wallet

## Bridge Instructions

From there, visit [http://reef.protousd.com](https://reef.protousd.com), then:

- Connect your source chain wallet; Zerion, MetaMask, WalletConnect and others are supported
- Connect your Reef wallet, **or** paste your Reef EVM address (0x format) and select 'Confirm'
- Enter the amount of $USDC tokens you want to bridge
- Select 'Transfer'
- You will approve two transactions: one to allow the bridge to handle your $USDC tokens, and the second to initiate the bridge

After confirming both transactions, the wrapped $USDC tokens on Reef Chain will be deposited to your wallet!
